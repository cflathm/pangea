This page hosts the R code underlying PANGEA. The accompanying working paper can be downloaded here:

[Westfall, J. (2016). PANGEA: Power ANalysis for GEneral Anova designs.](http://jakewestfall.org/publications/pangea.pdf)

A live version of PANGEA can be found [here](http://jakewestfall.org/pangea/).

This code relies on the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) library. To run the app locally, you will need to download the R script files, install the Shiny library, and point Shiny to the R scripts. A nice tutorial can be found [here](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson1/).
